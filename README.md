# Variational-Autoencoders


- The code was from this [repo](https://github.com/davidADSP/GDL_code).
- A good summary [medium post](https://towardsdatascience.com/understanding-variational-autoencoders-vaes-f70510919f73) of understanding VAE.
- A [Introduction course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rZufA635dq4) about generative model from MIT.

Variational Autoencoders (VAEs). In a nutshell, a VAE is an autoencoder whose encodings distribution is regularised during the training in order to ensure that its latent space has good properties allowing us to generate some new data. Moreover, the term “variational” comes from the close relation there is between the regularisation and the variational inference method in statistics.
